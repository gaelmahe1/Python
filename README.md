Pyhton Projects 


This project isn't complete and is still in the development satges

The goal of this python app is to check blockchain wallets and if the account hanst been used in 365 days then the account balance is transfered to your wallet.
This app as of now is able to check addresses you input manually, it isn't automated yet.

I am using the BlockCypher API to do this.
